**Version**: 1.0.0 Made first changes to the City explorer aplication.
1.1.1 Finished the changes to the Lab to make sure that the website was usable and able to get the features working to have the ability for error messages to render once clikcing on the explore button.

## Overview
This application will allow people to get a look at the city in certain segments. This will show parts of a city map with location of a city name that is inputted by the user.

## Getting Started
1. You will want to make a connection between your React application and a API server that is made lcoally on your machine that invoke a weather.io API.

## Architecture
- When getting this started and working I would say that I was using tools like location IQ, React, Vscode, github, as well as axios. Soon after I will be incorperating herokuapp as well.

## Change Log
**07/31/21** Made changes to the site to have the API called from location IQ.
**08/02/21** Finished changes with CSS and getting the error to render on the page when no input is placed in the form.
**08/08/21** Made changes to the front end by having another repository made to hold a API that would communicate weather data into the front end of the application. Got the UML updated as well.
