**Version**: 1.0.0 Made first changes to the City explorer aplication.
1.1.1 Finished the changes to the Lab to make sure that the website was usable and able to get the features working to have the ability for error messages to render once clikcing on the explore button.

## Overview
This application will allow people to get a look at the city in certain segments. This will show parts of a city map with location of a city name that is inputted by the user.

## Getting Started
1. You will want to make a connection between your React application and a API server that is made lcoally on your machine that invoke a weather.io API.

2. Create .env file. Make this file to hold you API keys. If they are for the front end REACT app, you will need to type REACT_APP_ then a variable for the key. Then the = and paste the key in. See the SAMPLE.env file for an example. Then enter .env in your .gitignore file.

3. Ensure that you are able to make location IQ account to be able to invoke API as well as make an API key that will be unique to your site in order for you to be able to show data about weather for the user.

4. At the end of all this you will want to have the APIs communicating between the front end and back end.

## Architecture
- When getting this started and working I would say that I was using tools like location IQ, React, Vscode, github, as well as axios. Soon after I will be incorperating herokuapp as well.

## Change Log
**07/31/21** Made changes to the site to have the API called from location IQ.
**08/02/21** Finished changes with CSS and getting the error to render on the page when no input is placed in the form.
**08/08/21** Made changes to the front end by having another repository made to hold a API that would communicate weather data into the front end of the application. Got the UML updated as well.
